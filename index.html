    <h1>Pixel art</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I believe you're a average pixel art enjoyer.</p>

    <p>
      Well then, I'm happy to have you here because I am about to showcase my
      very first group of pixel arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you go appreciating my art, I suggest you hit play on this great
      song just below, therefore you will be able to enjoy the maximum out of
      this experience.

      artistic presentation!
